A test file from OME and 3 files I have been working with:
- lif 5 series, 3 channels, 41 z
- exp2 ometiff from imic1 with 2 channels, 81 time points
- t4_1 ometiff from imic2 with 4 channels, 3 timepoints and 5 x 3 tiles?
dati marta efrem 24

I will check this number first together with:
- x, y dimension
- x resolution
- time resolution

I will the investigate ROI metadata.

Start with writing tests.
